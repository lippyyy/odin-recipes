        <h3>For the meatballs:</h3>

            <li>400g beef mince</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried mixed herbs</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and add olive oil. Once hot, add the onion and cook gently <br> without browning for 4-5 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the garlic, continue to cook for 2 minutes until aromatic, <br>then add the dried herbs, tomatoes and stock. Bring the sauce to a simmer, reduce the heat and simmer gently while you make the meatballs.</li>
            <li>For the meatballs, mix together the beef, garlic and herbs along with a decent pinch of salt and pepper. <br> Using wet hands roll into 20 balls.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add the olive oil. Once hot, fry the meatballs on all sides until <br> nicely coloured, being careful not to burn them. You may need to do this in batches. Transfer to the saucepan containing <br> the sauce.</li>
            <li>Continue to simmer the sauce for 10 minutes while you cook the spaghetti</li>
            <li>Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, add a pinch of salt and cook the spaghetti according to the packet <br> instructions. Once cooked, drain and tip into the saucepan with the meatball sauce. Mix well and serve hot. </li>
