        <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Granulated sugar (100g)</li>
            <li>Brown sugar (165g), packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter (115g), melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour (155g)</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon of bicarbonate soda</li>
            <li>Milk chocolate chunks (110g)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a larger  bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until <br> a paste forms (make sure there are no lumps).</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall of the <br> whisk and remain for a short white before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula <br> (Don't overmix, this would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting <br> in cakier cookies.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 <br> minutes. For a more toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight. <br> The longer it rests, the more complex the flavour will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C; line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto the parchment paper-lined <br> baking sheet, having at least 10cm of space between cookies and 5cm of space from <br> the edges of the pan so the cookies spread evenly</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges are starting to brown</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving, enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
